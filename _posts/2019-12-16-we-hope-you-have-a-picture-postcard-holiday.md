At this special time of year, we want to thank you so much for the kind words, encouragement, and support on our messages, videos, and music that we’ve been sending to you this year. During the holidays, I always like to keep this famous quote on the top of my mind: *“Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable, if anything is excellent or praiseworthy, think about such things.”* In that spirit, enjoy our new song inspired by that quote called “Picture Postcard Holiday.” To hear our full holiday message complete with our new song, watch this short video.
