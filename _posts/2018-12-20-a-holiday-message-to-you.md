"Where we love is home - home that our feet may leave, but not our hearts." Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.

Our original song this year is: "Home Is In Your Heart"   It begins -   "Thinking of YOU at this time of year, it brings back memories that we hold so dear...."   This song contains some special pictures of homes close to the hearts of people we helped this year and the sentiments that fill homes and hearts of people everywhere!  Please take a look and a listen and feel free to share with those who are close to your heart!  

Enjoy!   Warm Wishes - Joe & Karen
