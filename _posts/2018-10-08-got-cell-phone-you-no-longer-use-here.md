Do you have an old phone you no longer use? If so, don’t just throw it out. Besides simply trading it in, there are many other ways you can put old pieces of technology to good use.

Today we’ll be sharing five clever ways you can repurpose an old cell phone:

  **Use it as a glorified alarm clock.** Even after you remove the SIM card, most cell phones still have the capacity to connect to Wi-Fi. So, using that Wi-Fi connection, there are two alarm clock apps I recommend for those who need a little extra help getting up in the morning. The first is called “CARROT Alarm” and the second is “Pzizz."

  **Use it as an E-reader.** Old cell phones can easily be used to read e-books or listen to audiobooks through platforms like Audible.

  **Use it for home security.** There are a number of cool apps that will help you monitor your house while you’re away. Whether you want to keep an eye on your pets, your front door, or your baby’s room, an old cell phone can be an easy and inexpensive security solution.

  **Use it as a backup.** Keeping your old cell phone charged and in a convenient place could save you a lot of trouble in case your current phone stops working. Having a backup phone can be very useful in a pinch.

  **Donate it.** There are a number of charities that refurbish and distribute old cell phones to those in need.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
