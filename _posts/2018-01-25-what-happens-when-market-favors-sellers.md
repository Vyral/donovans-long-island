What is a seller’s market?

This is a question I’m commonly asked, so I’m going to address it today. Contrary to how the name may make it sound, a seller’s market actually means that there are more buyers than sellers.

A seller’s market is one that favors sellers. Let me give you an example. Imagine a town with 10,000 households and 300 houses for sale.

Not many people move in this town, but there are a couple of new businesses in town, and these businesses are drawing in new employees. All of these buyers are competing over the same 300 houses.

According to the laws of supply and demand, this sets sellers up for success.

When there is a limited supply of a product, the people who are selling it can take advantage of the increased demand. This applies to real estate as well. When the market is in the seller’s favor, they can sell quickly and for top dollar.

However, buyers in a seller’s market are not necessarily at a loss. There are some tips and tricks you can use as a buyer to still get a good deal.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
